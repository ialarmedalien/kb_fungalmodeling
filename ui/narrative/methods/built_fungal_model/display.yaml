    <p><b>Construct a fungal model through model propagation</b><p>.<p>Here we introduce a methodology to construct genome-scale fungal models in an automated fashion based on a curated set of reactions that are derived from 14 published fungal metabolic models.As the basis for the method, we produced a fungal model template that encompasses the biochemistry data from the published fungal models and the structural annotations from the associated fungal genomes.</p> <p>The research paper associated with this method is in preperation.</p>
